# Myo-Uno-Hand

## Project to get a low cost 3D virtualization of a hand in Unity for Dragonhacks 2016.

### Features 

This project includes: 

1. An Arduino Uno (~$15)
2. An HC-06 Bluetooth peripheral (~$5)
3. ~7 1000-2000 Ohm resistors (~$1)
4. Breadboard(s) (~$2)
5. Glove (~$2)
6. 5 flex sensors (~$10)

For the final implementation of this, we have an Arduino mini serving in place of the Uno in order to package all hardware onto the back of the glove.  This cuts costs by ~$5.

In total, this project costs $25-$35 for a working hand simulated on the Unity 3D engine, controlled by someone in real life wearing/moving the glove.
